The inflammation seen in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is part of its pathogenesis, and evidence of the antioxidant-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids suggests this to be an appropriate treatment for MGD.",66,3.7,Clin Interv Aging,3.5999,7,N,"Andrea Oleñik, Ignacio Jiménez-Alfaro, Nicolás Alejandre-Alba, Ignacio Mahillo-Fernández",2013,https://sci-hub.se/10.2147/CIA.S48955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039409/,reason,inflammation
Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp.,,"Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects a variable proportion of the general population, ranging from 3% to 10%. Malassezia yeast species (previously referred to as Pityrosporum) are thought to be the responsible organisms, and cause inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.",10,0.57,BMJ Clin Evid,N,92,N,"Luigi Naldi, Janouk Diphoorn",2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26016669/,reason,inflammation
